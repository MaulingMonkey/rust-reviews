Diff Review - introduce UnsafeFromPrimitive

While I might like to see some autogenerated doc comments describing the edge
conditions, the code itself seems reasonable otherwise (just wraps transmute in
a fn which adds the appropriate type information, making it slightly safer.)

| diff                  | rating | notes |
| --------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| .cargo_vcs_info.json  | ✔️ | |
| .travis.yml           | ✔️ | no_std testing, rustfmt
| Cargo.toml            | ✔️ | |
| Cargo.toml.orig       | ✔️ | |
| README.md             | ⚠️ | Unsafe blocks appear sound, are appropriate for this test code anyways.
| src/lib.rs            | ⚠️ | Adds a sane unsafe fn, but it seems sane.
| tests/lib.rs          | ⚠️ | Unsafe blocks appear sound, are appropriate for this test code anyways.
