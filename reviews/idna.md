# idna

## 0.2.0

Some minor refactoring and a lot of ugly rustfmt(?) reformatting.

## 0.1.5

Read all code, including skimmed every line of autogenerated rust tables. Looked
for any security issues, including any obvious DoS attacks from loops. Did not
try to manually verify any of the bidi/punycode/idna logic against a spec, but
test coverage looks excellent.
