# 0.6.0 / 0.5.2

Sound, although buggy AMD hardware makes implementing CryptoRng for RdRand/RdSeed a little unnerving to me ( https://github.com/nagisa/rust_rdrand/issues/12 )

    * All of `$gen::try_fill_bytes::imp` being `unsafe` is still concerning... but I believe it's sound now.
    * `RdRand`/`RdSeed` implement `CrytoRng`, which makes buggy AMD hardware concerning: https://github.com/nagisa/rust_rdrand/issues/12

## Concerns reduced since 0.4.0:
* https://github.com/nagisa/rust_rdrand/commit/7af432c6e315fde053d0056d1b7df893a865711a
    * unsafe blocks appear much larger than they need to be.

## Concerns fixed since 0.4.0:
* https://github.com/nagisa/rust_rdrand/commit/26a0a2f9d885fbbb8e14fa47c8a48e366cf15455
    * `mem::uninitialized()` u32s
    * `loop_rand!` uses `mem::uninitialized()` for $el:ty, easy to misuse!  Requires unsafe{} so technically sound.  Not exported.

    * `$gen::try_fill_bytes`:  UNSOUND!  word and buffer reference the same data.  As both are &mut Ts, this is 100% undefined behavior.
    * `ptr::copy_nonoverlapping`: This should really use a slice copy which should be just as safe...?  But maybe missing from core?

    * `is_x86_feature_detected`: I have not verified this is correct.

# 0.4.0

`$gen::try_fill_bytes` invokes undefined behavior (overlapping `&mut u32` and `&mut [u8]`): https://github.com/nagisa/rust_rdrand/issues/13.  0.5.x removed some use of `uninitialized`.
